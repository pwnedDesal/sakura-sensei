Since early 2014, I have participated in some Bug Bounty programmes (crowd sourced security). This is an exciting experience, especially when I find exotic vulnerabilities. I am acknowledged by [Facebook(3x)](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/thanks/), [Google](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/hall-of-fame/archive/), [Square](https://hackerone.com/square), [Yahoo](https://hackerone.com/yahoo). etc. for reporting security vulnerabilities.

What is [Bug Bounty](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/you-really-ready-bug-bounty-mark-litchfield?forceNoSplash=true)??
*Bug Bounty's by some are being treated as a cheap alternative to the more traditional forms of security practices that should be followed in a Secure Systems Development Life Cycle (S-SDLC).  A bug bounty is a device that compliments your S-SDLC and should not be used to replace traditional methods.*
